# model-smells

A catalog of model smells

It is a part of the work that will be published in the paper:

Eessaar, E., KÃ¤osaar, E., 2018. On Finding Model Smells Based on Code Smells. In Proceedings of CSOC2018. Springer (to appear)

[What is a model smell?](http://wiki.c2.com/?ModelSmell)

Each model is a set of statements in one or more languages that is (hopefully) syntactically correct and presents true propositions about the "thing" that it describes. Hopefully the model is formatted so that it is well usable.

A well usable model is useful and necessary for the same reason than [clean code](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/7-reasons-clean-code-matters).

It helps model users to better understand and evolve the models and thus also the modeled system.

Unclean (smelly) models and code have the same general problems (for instance, duplication, inconsistencies, high coupling).
Such problems cause [technical debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html). An artifact with a debt is not necessarily wrong (i.e. does not necessarily present false propositions) but its bad representation makes it more difficult to understand, maintain, reuse, and extend it. It will cause problems (interest payments) later.
